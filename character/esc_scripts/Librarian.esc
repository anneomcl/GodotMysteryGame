			say librarian "....." #sad face

			say player "What do you mean by that--? Anyway, can I see the ledger?"
			say librarian "Sure."
			say player "Hmmm... So it really was just the four of us. Could someone have snuck in here and changed it?"
			say librarian "Highly unlikely."
			say player "I guess I'll mark it down as a possibility anyway."
			say librarian "Unless someone passed through your barrier."
			say player "Did they?!"
			say librarian "Let's see, the civil reference guide says... hmm... yeah, it's not that secure, pretty old tech."
			say librarian "But still, anyone who passed through undetected is way passed your level."
			say librarian "Probably have the top crews looking into it already. Someone starts hacking barriers, you bet the Citrus squads and the Harvest Knights are chasing'em down."

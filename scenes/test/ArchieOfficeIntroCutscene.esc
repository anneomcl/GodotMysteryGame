	say archie "But if anyone in my squad was found to be a thief, (a petty thief as a small crimes officer!), that would desecrate every honor anointed to us by the Harvest Knights themselves."
	say player "Yeah...!"

	say archie "I expect you to use every skill and resource at hand to find the truthful core of this theft, your work could valiantly lance a nodule of impurity from our ranks."

	say player "I... just need to review! Just need a quick run-down and I'm sure I'll figure it out."
	say archie "Alright, if you need pointers, take a look at the books in my bookshelf or go to the LIBRARY."

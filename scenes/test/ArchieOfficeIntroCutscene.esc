	say player "Her hair rippled in golden brown curls, framing the teary-eyed, vulnerable face of a young girl in desperate need of an officer's help."
	say player "'Oh, officer,' she'd said, 'I just don't feel safe at night knowing those rapscallions are... congregating outside my residence, no doubt peering into my quarters...'"
	say player "Her eyes sparkled with tears, 'Isn't there anything you can do?' I stood from my desk and firmly held her hands in earnest."

	say player "Oh squash! Are you serious? My own case?" player_embarrassed
	say Archie "Do I look like someone who tells jokes, rookie? Of course I'm serious! We're completely strapped for resources,"
	say Archie "the whole team's assigned out on critical cases downstream. So we're sending you to investigate the Waldorf theft..."
	say Archie "I see you've already acquainted yourself with the case files."
	say player "Does this mean -- ?! Am I finally -- ?!?!? Oh no, it's happening... I'm not prepared for this..."
	say Archie "Calm down, rookie! You may have an assignment, but you're not an officer yet!"
	say player "But...?"
	say Archie "You're strictly tasked with INVESTIGATION. No funny business, no deal brokering, no arrests or altercations, got it? Just information gathering."
	say Archie "You'll want to gather as much EVIDENCE from the scene of the crime as possible and record any CLUES you can gather from talking with Ms. Waldorf."
	say Archie "Just take a look at these case files when you're ready to go."
